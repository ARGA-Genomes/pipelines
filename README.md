# EXPERIMENTAL

Please do not commit to this project at this time without discussion with Tim.

This is an experimental space to explore Apache Beam for GBIF data pipelines.

Topics of interest
 - data processing suitable for GBIF and ALA
 - simplified framework (Avro schemas instead of GBIF API models) 
 - validation / flagging  
 - generation of files (e.g. Avro) suitable for building e.g. SOLR without the need for HBase / Cassandra 
 - reducing boilerplate code
