### Convert a DwCA to an Avro file

The DwC2AvroPipeline demonstrates the reading of a DwC-A file converting the records into a new format and saving the result as an avro file.
 
It should be possibile to run it in your IDE as it uses the native runner with the output stored in the `demo/output` directory.
